This is a basic **Map Tool**, where you can **draw** or **input coordinates** to receive the following results:  
- **Distance** between the points  
- **Azimuth**  
- **Angle** (available in the three-point option)  

## 🚀 Features  

### 🔄 Coordinate Input & Switching  
- Swap between **2 and 3 sets of coordinates** using the ➕ **"plus"** button.  
- Revert back to **2 points** using the ➖ **"minus"** button.

  - This will remove everything: drawn points on the map, input fields, and resulting data.  

### ✏️ Submitting Coordinates  
- Press the **"Enter"** button below the input fields to submit coordinates.  
- If fields are **empty**, the application will warn you.  
- If incorrect data is entered, you will **receive a warning**.  

### 📊 Data Output  
The data you receive includes:  
- **Distance** between points  
- **Azimuth**  
- **Angle** (only in the three-point option)  

You can switch between units using the **dropdown menu**:  
- **Distance:** Kilometers (km) & Meters (m)  
- **Angle & Azimuth:** Degrees (°) & Radians (rad)  

### 🖊️ Drawing & Interaction  
- Click anywhere on the map to place a point.  
- The point's coordinates will be **automatically filled** in the input fields.  
- Drag and drop points to **modify their positions** – data updates instantly!
